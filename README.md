## 3. Abstract

This project enhances the RADAR-Pipeline by adding support for ingesting the data, computing features from this data and then finally exporting these computed features to a file. All of these steps can be configured by a user or a researcher through YAML syntaxes specified in a single `config` file.

The ingestion of data is done by using Apache Spark through pyspark. This ingested data is internally represented as a DataFrame, which makes performing operations on the columns to extract features easier. The extracted features from this DataFrame are then exported to a file.

## 4. RADAR-Pipeline

RADAR Pipeline is an open-source python package to help researchers and users working with RADAR data to ingest, analyze, visualize, and export their data, all from a single place. The package is designed to be flexible and extensible. The pipeline aims to:

-   Allow researchers to create and publish their own custom pipelines to analyze and visualize their data in a reproducible and extensible way.
-   Allow users to consume and run published pipelines and run their own analysis on their data.

## 5. Project Goals

The following are the goals that were set for the project at the beginning of the program. ‚úÖ represents that the goal has been achieved. üöß represents that the goal is in progress and üìù represents that the goal is to be done in the future.

-   ‚úÖ Support a larger variety of data into the pipeline, using well-defined schemas
-   üöß Add reading capability from multiple data sources
-   ‚úÖ Enhance feature analysis of the data
-   üìù Add visualization support to the pipeline
-   ‚úÖ Use software best practices and add comprehensive documentation to make the pipeline more developer-friendly
-   ‚úÖ Add capability to generate and save a statistical report/log of the data processes

Apart from these goals that were set at the beginning of the project, we also added the following features to the project along the way:

-   Support for reading data and features located locally or as a GitHub repository
-   Add mock data and mock features for testing and demonstration purposes
-   Add ability for reading data with or without a predefined schema
-   Add ability to compress data while exporting
